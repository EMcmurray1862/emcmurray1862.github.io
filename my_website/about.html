    <p>Hey y'all! My name is Lizzy. I'm kind of an odd charcter. Well, not necessarily odd, but I have a very variety of tastes. I love makeup. (You can see my porfolio page for some of my favorite looks I've done.) I love dancing, singing, and playing electric guitar. But I also love science, math, and engineering. And recently, I've become a lover of the enviornment. (If you'd like to know more about that, you can check the "Summer of 2019" page.) See? I told you I'm a little bit of an odd character. If you know me or have talked to me in person, then you REALLY understand the extent of that. But yeah, that's pretty much about it. Neat, huh? </p>
